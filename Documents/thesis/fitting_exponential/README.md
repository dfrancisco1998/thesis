This folder focuses on fitting the T1, T2, T2* data
please use `/home/david/Documents/thesis/fitting_exponential/attemp12052023.ipynb` as an example on how to generate data using function from `Random_exp_data.py` and how to fit data using `expon_decay.py`

in general the fitting functions need a numpy array for time and y values, thus they only do one sample fitting at a time.
